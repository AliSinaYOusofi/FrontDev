                    HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a computer language that's 
                    used to create and structure content on the internet. It's the backbone of 
                    every website and is used to define how a web page looks and what it contains.

            <div>

                    Basic HTML structure
                </h1>
                <p>
                    HTML files contain a structured set of code that computers can read and interpret as a webpage. 
                    Here's the basic structure of an HTML document:
                </p>

                <pre><code class="language-python">
                print("Hello, world!")
                </code></pre>
            </div>

            
        </div>
    )
}
