            <h1> HTML Quotation</h1>
            <p>
                When quoting someone or citing an external source in a webpage, 
                web developers use HTML quotation tags to display the quote in the intended format. 
                These tags not only help in displaying the quote in a 
                defined manner but also assist in making web pages semantic.
            </p>

            <h1 className="mt-10"> Blockquote Tag {"(<blockquote>)"}: </h1>
            <p>
                The {"<blockquote>"} tag is used for longer direct quotes that take up several lines 
                on a page. This tag signifies that the block of text is a separate and 
                independent passage, placed in contrast to the surrounding text, text which 
                is typically indented to separate it from the other content. Most browsers also 
                provide a default rendering of 
                blockquote tag with left and right margins and smaller font size.

            <h1 className="mt-10"> Quotation Tag {"(<q>)"}:</h1>
            <p>
            The {"<q>"} tag is meant for short quotes and provides quotation marks around 
                the text when rendered in a browser. The rendering can vary in different browsers, 
                but most often, it shows quotes around the text.

            <h1 className="mt-10">Abbreviation Tag {"(<abbr>)"}</h1>
            <p>
                The {"<abbr>"} tag defines an abbreviation. It typically displays 
                the abbreviation as underlined and with dotted border when 
                the mouse is over an abbreviation. 
                It is beneficial for accessibility purposes.

            <h1 className="mt-10"> Address Tag {"(<address>)"}</h1>
            <p>The {"<address>"} tag is used to present contact information for an author or owner of a document or an article. If used inside {"<footer>"} or {"<article>"} elements it provides contact information for that particular content.</p>

            <h1 className="mt-10"> Citation Tag {"(<cite>)"}</h1>
            <p>The {"<cite>"} tag is used to cite a reference to a creative work, such as a book or movie. It represents the title of the work which is being referenced. Some browsers put it in italics, and the tag provides semantic value to the text.</p>
            <CodeBlock
            code={`<p><cite>A Tale of Two Cities</cite> is a novel by Charles Dickens.</p>`}

            />

            <h1 className="mt-10"> Bi-Directional Override Tag {"(<bdo>)"}</h1>
            <p>
                The {"<bdo>"} tag is used to override the direction of the text, 
                which could be reversed from the default if the language, such as Arabic or 
                Hebrew, is right-to-left. The tag provides developers with options to keep text 
                in a specific direction, even when other 
                language text is present in the HTML document.
            </p>
            <CodeBlock
            code={`<p><bdo dir="rtl">Hebrew text that should be right-to-left.</bdo> This text should be left-to-right. <bdo dir="rtl">More Hebrew text.</bdo></p>`}
